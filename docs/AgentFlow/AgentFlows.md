# Technical Design Document: Modular Agent-Based Legal Assistant System
## 1. Introduction
- Purpose and scope of the document
- System overview and goals
- Audience
- Definitions and terminology
## 2. Design Rationale and Principles
- Rationale for refactoring and architectural changes
- Adoption of central hub (mediator) pattern for agent orchestration
- Principles: modularity, extensibility, auditability
- Justification for local deployment and technology choices
## 3. System Architecture Overview
- High-level architecture diagram (to be inserted)
- Core technology stack
    - Python, mcp-use, Gradio, SQLite, ChromaDB, Pydantic, PyPDF2, Tesseract, FastAPI, Flask, pytest, Windows OS, logging
- Component and agent overview
## 4. Central Hub and Data Store Design
- Role of the central database and file storage
- Data flow and agent interaction patterns
- Schema and structure (SQLite, ChromaDB)
- Document and metadata processing strategies
- Audit trail and logging mechanisms
## 5. Agent Responsibilities and Modules
### 5.1 Intake Agent
- Functional overview
- Data ingestion and pre-processing
- Interface with central hub
### 5.2 Knowledge Store Agent
- Long-term data persistence and retrieval
- Metadata management
- ChromaDB and vector store integration
### 5.3 Research Agent
- Search, retrieval, and research workflows
- Interaction with knowledge store
### 5.4 Analysis Agent
- Data analysis and synthesis
- Coordination with research and knowledge store agents
### 5.5 Document Drafting Agent
- Document generation and formatting
- Use of PyPDF2, Tesseract, and output storage
## 6. Gradio Frontend
- UI/UX requirements
- Real-time interaction features
- Integration with backend agents
## 7. Centralized Communication and Orchestration Strategy
- No direct agent-to-agent handoff rationale
- Benefits for auditability, extensibility, debugging
## 8. Auditability and Logging
- Detailed audit trail requirements
- Logging strategy and implementation
- Compliance and traceability considerations
## 9. Extensibility and Modularity
- Strategies for future agent addition or replacement
- Use of Pydantic for data validation and schema enforcement
- Plugin/module interface guidelines
## 10. Debugging, Testing, and Quality Assurance
- Use of pytest for automated testing
- Debugging strategies
- Error handling and recovery
## 11. Scaling and Future-Proofing
- Current limitations (local-only, single machine)
- Considerations for remote/distributed agent orchestration (Google A2A-style)
- Abstraction layers for potential future integration
## 12. Security and Compliance Considerations
- Data privacy
- Local storage security
- User access controls
## 13. Deployment and Maintenance
- Installation and configuration steps
- Update and patching workflow
- Maintenance best practices
## 14. Appendix
- Glossary
