        "• 'create database' → Call tool with this request\n"
        "• 'database for the app' → Call tool with this request\n"
        "• 'setup database' → Call tool with this request\n"
        "• 'new case' → Call tool with this request\n"

        "User: 'hello' → You: [CALL route_to_ceo_logic('hello')] which handles the greeting\n"
        "User: 'create database for app' → You: [CALL route_to_ceo_logic('create database for app')] which handles delegation\n"
        "User: 'setup new case database' → You: [CALL route_to_ceo_logic('setup new case database')] which handles delegation\n\n"

        "• Don't say 'I have successfully created...' without calling the tool\n"
        "• Don't describe databases, collections, or configurations you didn't actually create\n"
        "• Don't fabricate technical details about work you haven't delegated\n\n"
